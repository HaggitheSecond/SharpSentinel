# SharpSentinel (work in progress)
Loads datasets from esa's sentinel-mission (at some point, not quite there yet)

ESA's Sentinel-mission => https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Overview4

Data Access to all Sentinel-Data => https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home

As far as i'm aware there's no parser for sentinel-data yet which makes working with it in the .NET-Framework very annoying.
I'm new to these dataformats, am not quite sure what to expect and have generally no idea how much work is involved. Right now
this is a fun sideproject without any further goals. 

If you see any errors, problems or have fun facts about sentinel related stuff, **please** create an issue, thanks :)

### Todo:

⋅⋅* Load SAFE-Data (Sentinel 1 & 2)
⋅⋅* Load von netCDF-Daten (Sentinel 3)
⋅⋅* Provide editor like overview over the files
